# the-100-problem
Solution to radio 4 today programme puzzle number 1 written in python

GOAL: to write a programme that solves the following puzzle from the BBC Radio/
today programme:
Puzzle No.1 â€“ Monday 3 July
Take the digits 1,2,3 up to 9 in numerical order and put either a plus sign/
or a minus sign or neither between the digits to make a sum that adds up to/
100. /
For example, one way of achieving this is: 1 + 2 + 34 - 5 + 67 - 8 + 9 = 100,/
which uses six plusses and minuses./
What is the fewest number of plusses and minuses you need to do this?


I have actually written a program that attempts to find a solution, give an incremental number series 1,2,3...etc of any length, and any number. The program will attempt to find the simplest solution (ie the one with the fewest inserted operators) first.
